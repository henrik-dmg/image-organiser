# image-organiser

This is a simple tool I'm writing mainly for my own purposes. It organises files from my camera's SD card into folders based on the date the photo was taken. It also renames the files to a more sensible format.
Initially I used Swift because that's what I'm most familiar with, but I'm now rewriting it in Rust since it's all the rage now and I've been meaning to try it for a while.

## Usage

```
image-organiser <configuration_file>
```

## Configuration

TODO

## Progress

10% at most. I just started playing around with Rust and I have very little idea what I'm doing.
